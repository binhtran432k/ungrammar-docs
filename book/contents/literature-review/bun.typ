== Bun

Bun, a modern JavaScript runtime, offers a compelling platform for developing language servers due to its speed, versatility, and rich feature set. As a unified tool encompassing package management, bundling, transpilation, testing, and task running, Bun streamlines the development workflow and enhances developer productivity @bib-bun.

By leveraging Bun's capabilities, developers can build high-performance and feature-rich language servers with improved development efficiency. In the following subsections, we will delve into specific aspects of Bun that make it a suitable choice for #gls("lsp") development.

=== Bun as a Package Manager

Bun offers a high-performance and feature-rich package manager, designed to streamline dependency management for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. While compatible with npm and yarn, Bun introduces several enhancements:

- *Speed*: Leveraging its core runtime optimizations, Bun's package installation and resolution are significantly faster than traditional package managers.
- *Workspace support*: Bun seamlessly manages monorepo structures, allowing for efficient dependency management across multiple packages.
- *Zero-config approach*: Bun often eliminates the need for complex configuration files, simplifying project setup.
- *Compatibility*: Bun supports npm-style `package.json` files, ensuring compatibility with existing projects.

By adopting Bun as a package manager, we can experience faster build times and improved project organization.

=== TypeScript Support in Bun

Bun provides excellent built-in support for TypeScript, eliminating the need for additional transpilation steps. This integration streamlines the development workflow and improves performance.

Key features of Bun's TypeScript support:

- *Fast compilation*: Bun's optimized TypeScript compiler ensures rapid build times.
- *Type checking*: Rigorous type checking helps catch errors early in the development process.
- *JSX support*: Enables seamless development of React and other #gls("jsx")-based components.
- *Interoperability*: Works seamlessly with existing TypeScript projects and tools.

By utilizing Bun's TypeScript capabilities, we can enhance code reliability, maintainability, and developer experience.

=== Bun as a Bundler

Bun's bundling capabilities are designed to optimize JavaScript applications for production deployment. By combining modules into a single file, bundling improves load times and reduces the number of #gls("http") requests.

Key features of Bun's bundler:

- *Fast bundling*: Leveraging Bun's core performance optimizations for efficient bundling.
- *Tree-shaking*: Eliminates unused code to create smaller and faster bundles.
- *Code splitting*: Divides the application into smaller chunks for lazy loading.
- *Minification*: Reduces code size through minification and obfuscation.

Bun's bundling features make it a suitable choice for building production-ready JavaScript applications.

=== Bun as a Test Runner

Bun includes a built-in test runner, providing a convenient way to execute and manage tests within the same environment as the application code. This integration simplifies the testing workflow and promotes efficient test execution.

Key features of Bun's test runner:

- *Fast test execution*: Leveraging Bun's performance optimizations for rapid test feedback.
- *Test discovery*: Automatically finds and executes test files.
- *Assertion library*: Provides a comprehensive set of assertion functions for writing tests.
- *Code coverage*: Generates code coverage reports to assess test effectiveness.

By utilizing Bun's test runner, we can streamline the testing process and improve code quality.
