== Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) <sec-bdd>

#gls("bdd", mode:"full") is a collaborative approach to software development
that focuses on defining and delivering software features based on the desired
behavior as understood by stakeholders. Gherkin (@sec-gherkin), a #gls("dsl"),
is commonly used to describe these behaviors in a human-readable format. We
will explore the key principles, benefits, and challenges of #gls("bdd") with
Gherkin.

#gls("bdd") with Gherkin offers a valuable approach to software development by
focusing on behavior, collaboration, and testability. By effectively leveraging
#gls("bdd") and Gherkin, we can improve their ability to deliver
high-quality software that meets the needs of our users @bib-bdd.

=== Key Principles of BDD

- *Collaboration*: #gls("bdd") emphasizes collaboration among stakeholders,
  including business analysts, developers, and testers, to ensure a shared
  understanding of the system's requirements.
- *Focus on Behavior*: #gls("bdd") shifts the focus from technical
  implementation details to the observable behavior of the system from the
  user's perspective.
- *#gls("tdd", mode:"full")*: #gls("bdd") often incorporates #gls("tdd")
  (@sec-tdd) practices, where tests are written before the corresponding code,
  driving development towards the desired behavior.
- *Living Documentation*: Gherkin scenarios can serve as living documentation,
  providing a clear and up-to-date record of the system's requirements.

=== Benefits of Using BDD with Gherkin

- *Improved Communication*: #gls("bdd") and Gherkin provide a common language
  for stakeholders, facilitating effective communication and reducing
  misunderstandings.
- *Enhanced Collaboration*: By focusing on shared understanding of behavior,
  #gls("bdd") fosters collaboration among team members.
- *Early Validation*: Gherkin scenarios can be used to validate requirements
  early in the development process, preventing costly rework later.
- *Testability*: Gherkin's structured format makes it well-suited for automated
  testing, ensuring that the system meets the specified requirements.
- *Living Documentation*: Gherkin scenarios can serve as living documentation,
  providing a clear and up-to-date reference for the system's behavior.

=== Gherkin in Practice

Gherkin has been successfully adopted in various development methodologies and
projects, including Agile, DevOps, and #gls("tdd") (@sec-tdd). It is commonly
used to:

- Define user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Create executable specifications for automated testing.
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders.
- Improve the overall quality and reliability of software systems.
