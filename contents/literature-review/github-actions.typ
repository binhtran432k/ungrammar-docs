== Github Actions <sec-githubactions>

GitHub Actions has emerged as a powerful and popular platform for automating
software development workflows, including #gls("ci") and #gls("cd"). This
section will explore the key features, benefits, and challenges of using GitHub
Actions, focusing on its role in streamlining development processes and
ensuring code quality.

GitHub Actions is a valuable tool for automating #gls("ci")/#gls("cd")
pipelines and improving software development workflows. Its versatility,
scalability, and integration with the GitHub ecosystem make it a popular choice
for developers of all levels. By leveraging GitHub Actions, we can streamline
their development processes, enhance code quality, and accelerate
time-to-market @bib-github-actions.

=== Key Features of GitHub Actions

- *Workflow Automation*: GitHub Actions allows we to automate various
  development tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying our code.
- *Customizable Workflows*: We can create custom workflows to match our
  specific project requirements and integrate with other tools and services.
- *Pre-built Actions*: GitHub provides a marketplace of pre-built actions that
  can be easily integrated into our workflows.
- *Integration with GitHub Ecosystem*: GitHub Actions seamlessly integrates
  with GitHub's other features, such as pull requests, issues, and releases.
- *Scalability*: GitHub Actions can handle projects of all sizes, from small
  personal projects to large enterprise applications.

=== Benefits of Using GitHub Actions

- *Increased Efficiency*: Automation of routine tasks reduces manual effort and
  accelerates development cycles.
- *Improved Code Quality*: Regular testing and code analysis help identify and
  fix issues early in the development process.
- *Simplified Deployment*: GitHub Actions can automate the deployment process,
  making it easier to release new versions of our software.
- *Enhanced Collaboration*: GitHub Actions facilitates collaboration among team
  members by providing a shared platform for automation and testing.
- *Cost-Effective*: GitHub Actions is a hosted service, eliminating the need
  for managing our own #gls("ci")/#gls("cd") infrastructure.
