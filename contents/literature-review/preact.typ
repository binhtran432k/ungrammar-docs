== Preact <sec-preact>

Preact is a popular JavaScript library that serves as a lightweight alternative
to React. Designed to be smaller and faster, Preact offers many of the same
features and benefits while maintaining a minimal footprint. This section will
explore the key characteristics, advantages, and considerations of using Preact
in your web development projects.

Preact is a compelling choice for developers seeking a lightweight and
high-performance alternative to React. Its focus on simplicity, speed, and
compatibility with React's #gls("api") makes it a valuable tool for building
modern web applications. While there may be some considerations and limitations
to keep in mind, Preact's benefits often outweigh the challenges, making it a
strong contender for your next project @bib-preact.

=== Key Features of Preact

- *Virtual DOM*: Preact utilizes a virtual #gls("dom"), similar to React, for
  efficient updates and rendering.
- *JSX Support*: Preact supports #gls("jsx") syntax, making it easy to write
  declarative components.
- *Small Footprint*: Preact has a significantly smaller bundle size compared to
  React, leading to faster load times and improved performance.
- *API Compatibility*: Preact maintains a high degree of compatibility with
  React's #gls("api"), making it easier for developers to migrate from React or
  use both libraries together.
- *Community and Ecosystem*: Preact has a growing community and ecosystem of
  tools and resources, supporting its development and adoption.

=== Benefits of Using Preact

- *Improved Performance*: Preact's smaller bundle size and efficient rendering
  engine contribute to faster page load times and better user experience.
- *Lightweight and Minimalistic*: Preact's focus on simplicity and minimalism
  makes it suitable for projects that prioritize performance and
  maintainability.
- *Compatibility with React*: The similarity between Preact and React's
  #gls("apis") allows for easier migration and the potential to use both
  libraries together in larger projects.
- *Active Community*: Preact benefits from a growing community of developers
