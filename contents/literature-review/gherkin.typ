== Gherkin <sec-gherkin>

Gherkin is a #gls("dsl") widely used in #gls("bdd") (@sec-bdd) to describe
software requirements in a human-readable format. This section explores the key
features, benefits, and challenges of using Gherkin, focusing on its
applications in defining requirements and facilitating user acceptance testing.

Gherkin is a valuable tool for defining requirements and facilitating user
acceptance testing in BDD projects. Its human-readable format, collaboration
benefits, and testability make it a popular choice among development teams. By
effectively leveraging Gherkin, organizations can improve the quality and
efficiency of their software development processes @bib-gherkin.

=== Key Features of Gherkin

- *Domain-Specific Language*: Gherkin uses plain English keywords (`Given`,
  `When`, `Then`) to define scenarios and their expected outcomes.
- *Scenario-Based Approach*: Gherkin emphasizes a scenario-based approach,
  focusing on the behavior of the system from the user's perspective.
- *Collaboration*: Gherkin fosters collaboration between stakeholders by
  providing a shared language for discussing requirements.
- *Testability*: The structured format of Gherkin makes it well-suited for
  automated testing, enabling continuous verification of system behavior.

=== Benefits of Using Gherkin

- *Improved Communication*: Gherkin provides a common language for
  stakeholders, including business analysts, developers, and testers, to
  discuss and understand requirements.
- *Enhanced Collaboration*: By focusing on the system's behavior, Gherkin
  promotes collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
- *Early Validation*: Gherkin-based tests can be executed early in the
  development process, ensuring that the system meets the specified
  requirements.
- *Living Documentation*: Gherkin scenarios can serve as living documentation,
  providing a clear and up-to-date record of the system's intended behavior.

=== Gherkin in Practice

Gherkin has been successfully adopted in various development methodologies and
projects, including Agile, DevOps, and #gls("tdd") (@sec-tdd). It is commonly
used to:
- Define user stories and acceptance criteria.
- Create executable specifications for automated testing.
- Facilitate communication between stakeholders.
- Improve the overall quality and reliability of software systems.
