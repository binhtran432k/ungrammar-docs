== ESBuild
<sec-esbuild>

ESBuild is a relatively new JavaScript bundler that has gained significant
attention due to its exceptional performance and innovative approach. We will
explore the key features, benefits, and challenges of using ESBuild for
bundling JavaScript applications.

ESBuild has emerged as a powerful and efficient bundler for modern JavaScript
applications. Its exceptional performance, focus on simplicity, and growing
community support make it a compelling choice for developers seeking to
optimize their build processes. While there may be some limitations to
consider, ESBuild's strengths significantly outweigh the challenges. As the
ESBuild ecosystem continues to evolve, it is likely to become an even more
popular and indispensable tool for JavaScript development @bib-esbuild.

=== Key Features

- *Bundling*: ESBuild efficiently combines multiple JavaScript modules into a
  single file for optimized delivery.
- *Minification*: Automatically minifies the bundled code, reducing its size
  and improving load times.
- *Tree Shaking*: Eliminates unused code, further optimizing bundle size and
  performance.
- *Source Maps*: Generates source maps for debugging purposes, enabling easier
  navigation between the original code and the bundled output.
- *Plugin Support*: Extensible through plugins, allowing for customization and
  integration with other tools.
- *TypeScript Support*: Built-in support for TypeScript, including type
  checking and transpilation.

=== Performance and Speed

- *Parallel Processing*: ESBuild leverages parallel processing to significantly
  speed up the bundling process, especially for large projects.
- *Incremental Builds*: Optimizes rebuild times by only recompiling affected
  modules when changes are made.
- *Efficient Algorithms*: Employs efficient algorithms for code analysis and
  optimization, resulting in faster bundling and smaller output sizes.
