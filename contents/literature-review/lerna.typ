== Lerna and NX <sec-lerna>

Lerna and NX are powerful tools designed to manage complex JavaScript monorepo
projects efficiently. This section will explore their key features, benefits,
and challenges, as well as their integration with each other to create a robust
development environment.

Lerna and NX offer a powerful solution for managing JavaScript monorepo
projects. By combining their strengths, developers can benefit from improved
organization, faster development, and simplified dependency management. While
there may be a learning curve associated with using these tools, the long-term
benefits outweigh the challenges @bib-lerna.

=== Lerna

- *Monorepo Management*: Lerna is specifically designed for managing JavaScript
  projects with multiple packages within a single repository.
- *Versioning and Publishing*: Lerna simplifies versioning and publishing of
  individual packages within the monorepo.
- *Dependency Management*: Handles dependencies between packages within the
  monorepo, ensuring consistent versions across the project.
- *Workspaces*: Lerna supports workspaces, allowing developers to work on
  multiple packages simultaneously within a single project.

=== NX

- *Build System*: NX is a versatile build system that can be used to manage and
  build projects of any size and complexity.
